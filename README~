   -make install

3) Setup an FTP server which has access to festalk folder. Wu-FTPD is the preffered FTP server. 

4) Change permissions of conf,ini and wave folders inside festalk to read & write.

5) Make changes to system.conf
 
   -LOCALHOST is the IP Address of system running festival server, that is local computer.
   -PORT is the port which you want to run the socket for FESTALK
   -home is the address of the folder in which the festalk system is kept.
     for eg - if it is kept in /home/ravis/ then home address is /home/ravis/festalk/ .

6) Start server
   - Change working directory to go to festalk folder.
   - perl server.pl


FESTIVAL CHANGES :-

1) You can add any new Language in Language_ID.conf with a new language_Id (a number) and festival command for setting that language. Then you can send that number in conf file.

Conf FORMAT :-

Text "ENTER YOUR TEXT HERE"
Language_ID 1
Token asdj

HOW TO USE IT FROM OTHER SIDE ????

1) Send generated conf file in "conf" folder of festalk.
2) To the socket with ipaddress and port defined in system.conf, send message "conf_file_name".
   NOTE :- conf_file name should not be echo_on.
3) Download ini and wave file from ini and wave folder of festalk respectively. Both with the same name as Token specified in conf file.
4) Send command "Delete Token" to delete all the files (conf, ini and wave) to socket. Token is the mentioned token in conf file.

It will work !
